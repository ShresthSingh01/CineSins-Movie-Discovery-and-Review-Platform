## 🧬 Core Architecture: The Thesis of Self-Discovery

Most recommendation engines tell you what's popular; we tell you **who you are**. CinemaDNA analyzes every movie against a set of invisible emotional dimensions to build your unique profile.

### 1. 🧪 Personality Quick Test (Onboarding)
Begin your journey with a 60-second psychological deep-dive. Our proprietary 5-question test maps your tolerance for cognitive load, your emotional resilience, and your bias toward comfort, instantly assigning you one of 6 cinematic archetypes.

### 2. 📊 The DNA Dashboard
A comprehensive visualized breakdown of your cinematic soul.
* **Archetype Tracking**: Are you an *Intellectual Explorer* or a *Comfort Watcher*?
* **Mood Velocity**: Track your emotional trends over time on a dynamic `<canvas>` sparkline.
* **Metric Distribution**: Deep analysis of *Emotional Intensity*, *Cognitive Load*, and *Comfort Score*.

### 3. 🧠 Zero-Scroll Decision Engine
The antidote to analysis paralysis. Stop browsing and start deciding. Our decision engine takes your current constraints—Mood, Time, Company—and picks the perfect high-confidence film from your local intelligence cache.

### 4. 🧠 Semantic Search & Intent Parsing
Natural language discovery. Type naturally: *"Something dark and thought-provoking under 90 mins"* or *"Feel-good movies without too much violence"*. Our heuristic parser translates intent into precise metric filters.

### 5. 🌍 Cultural & Regional Intelligence
Explore cinema through its global hubs. Curated entry points into Indian Cinema, East Asian masterpieces, and European Arthouse, complete with cultural context and regional moods.

## 🛡️ Focus through Rationalization: What we removed & why

To maintain a clean, analytical, data-first privacy-focused aesthetic, the following features were intentionally removed or disabled:

* **Removed `sceneTags`**: Manual taxonomy introduces friction. We use automated emotional analytics derived from metadata and reviews.
* **Removed `watchNow`**: Deep-linking to streaming vendors turns an analysis tool into a consumption app. We focus on pre-watch analysis and post-watch insight.
* **Removed `compatibility`**: Personality is personal. We've pivoted from social gimmicks to single-user deep-dive analytics.
* **Removed `neonUI`**: Sprawling animations and "Spin Again" gamification distract from data-first movie intelligence.
